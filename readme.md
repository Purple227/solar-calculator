Total Load --> Inverter --> Battery --> Solah Panel

Total Number Of Loads( Based on selected Appliances)
Greater than previous inverter but less than or equal to the choosen inverter

Inverter Type (Inverter in KVA)
1 = Battery(1 
1.2 =  1
1.6 = 2
2.0 = 2
2.4 = 2

Multiply by 0.6 equal to maximum load inverter can take


3.0 = 4
3.5 = 4
Multyply by 0.7 


5.0 = 8
7.5 = 8
10 = 8
12 = 12
15 = 16
20 = 16
Multiply by 0.8

2) Number of battery needed is depended on inverter as stated after = above

3) Number of Solah Panel = Double number of Battery 

220amp battery 

280W panel
